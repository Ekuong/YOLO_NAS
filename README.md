# YOLO_NAS COCA and PSI Cans Identify
Deep Learning for Image Processing


# ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
YOLO-NAS is still very fresh. If you notice that our notebook behaves incorrectly - especially if you experience errors that prevent you from going through the tutorial - don't hesitate! Let us know and open an issue on the Roboflow Notebooks repository.

# Pro Tip: Use GPU Acceleration
If you are running this notebook in Google Colab, navigate to Edit -> Notebook settings -> Hardware accelerator, set it to GPU, and then click Save. This will ensure your notebook uses a GPU, which will significantly speed up model training times.

# Steps in this Tutorial
In this tutorial, we are going to cover:

# Before you start
Install YOLO-NAS
Inference with pre-trained COCO model
Finding open source datasets

# ‚≠êÔ∏è Training YOLO-NAS on your custom dataset ‚≠êÔ∏è
Load trained model
Evaluate trained model
Inference with trained model

# üî• Let's begin!
go into COCA_PSI_Train_YOLONAS_Custom_Dataset_EK_update.ipynb 
And test it.

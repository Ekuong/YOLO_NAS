# YOLO_NAS COCA and PSI Cans Identify
Deep Learning for Image Processing
⚠️ Disclaimer
YOLO-NAS is still very fresh. If you notice that our notebook behaves incorrectly - especially if you experience errors that prevent you from going through the tutorial - don't hesitate! Let us know and open an issue on the Roboflow Notebooks repository.

Pro Tip: Use GPU Acceleration
If you are running this notebook in Google Colab, navigate to Edit -> Notebook settings -> Hardware accelerator, set it to GPU, and then click Save. This will ensure your notebook uses a GPU, which will significantly speed up model training times.
